            <p><span>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING 1</span>
                - Grade: A, A+
                Within this module we covered the creation of a product for a given purpose. Here we were tasked with creating 3 products. A website, kiosk, and a database management system. We were introduced into the software life cycle and covered part of the cycle within the first year. We were required to obtain information via interviews & group presentations to create a draft which accurately fits the requirements of the client. We produced wireframes, document regarding the products and presentations to be displayed to the client and for their use.

                <p><span>DATABASES 1</span>
                    - Grade: A, A+
                    Within this module, we covered data modelling techniques to establish, modify and maintain data structures and associated components like entities, relationships, and attribute definitions.
                         We were taught how to establish database applications and transfer and apply them to development requirements into a physical database structure using industry-standard software (MySQL and SQL). For the first exam were tested our knowledge of the design and terms of Databases. In the second exam were in groups and required to design a database using the knowledge we learned within the first exam for exampling querying, deleting, and modifying data within a database.

                    <p><span>Problem Solving and Programming</span>
                        - Grade: A, A+
                        Within this module we covered the basics of Object orientated programming using Java. We covered topics such as classes, objects, inheritance, and encapsulation within the first year. We created several programs to develop our ability to problem solve and we were tested within this at the end of the term via exam testing our Java knowledge. My programs have been uploaded onto my GitHub for deeper information regarding it.

                    <p><span> Development:</span>
                        - Grade: A, A-
                        Within this module we covered the HTML and CSS initially to iterate through the possibilities of what can be made using these tools. We were then tasked to produce a personal portfolio which would then be assessed to see how well we understood the 2 technologies. Within this assignment I was awarded an A which I do believe was deserved. I began to think outside of the box to make my project personal and used applications such as Adobe Photoshop to create unique backgrounds.    For the second assignment we covered the fundamentals of JavaScript and then we were given premade code of a ‘space-invader’ type game, and we were tasked with creating several different functions to allow the game to work as required with the requirements sheet distributed by the course leader. We were required to complete this assignment within a specific period which allows us to experience the pressure of completing a project for a ‘client’ in a real-world environment. For this assignment I achieved an A-.

                        - Grade: B, A-
                        In this module, we covered the use of networks, protocols, and the transferring of data between devices. In specific how networks affect our daily lives and the role of data networking in human networks. Topics covered within this module include the following: Reference Model
                    -	Network Architecture
                    -	Application Layer 
                    -	DNS, FTP, Telnet
                    -	Transport Layer 
                    -	IP Addressing
                    -	Network Layer</p>
