Again, I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a 3rd party API.

            <p>Project 3: Daniel’s charity cup – After covering my first module in Web Development a friend of mine asked if I could create a landing page which would allow people to buy tickets for an event regarding the passing of his mother. Although I did not have much knowledge working with a task this big, I took it on a researched the problems as I came across them. I was able to create the page via HTML, CSS then using the capabilities of HTML I was able to link one payment method via an external webpage called GoFundMe and the second option was a PayPal button I was able to create and link back to the website. <a href="https://evannikaloasthefirst.github.io/DanielsCharityCup/">Application Link</a> </p> 

            <p>Project 4: MySQL – Group project – We were required to create a database where we created multiple table, primary key, foreign keys and more with the assignment.
                We were required to add data,alter and delete table from the table via various queries. We ensured that the correct data integrity was followed. I as project leader was in charge of assigning roles to each member based on what areas of the database each participant was comfortable with based on previous examination results. We used MySQL to produce this project and in the end we achieved an A+.

                <p>Project 6: Space Invader – This was an assignment set for my find graded task within my web development module. Here we were tasked with adding functionality to a game which already possesses the base HTML and CSS for the game. This task really provided me with the ability to use the internet to overcome issues where I was unclear on as I did not have constant access to my lecturer. My problem-solving abilities really improved as I was required to uses resources such as StackOverflow and Youtube to really understand concepts within JavaScript. For this assignment I achieved an A-.
